# Blog

This is the week 2 of 12 Web Apps in 12 Weeks Challenge, which is planned and made by
[Mackenzie Child](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/2/).

In this application, I built a blog without scaffold in Rails 4 that allows visitors see the pages and leave comments.
Only administrator of this website posts articles and deletes comments.

# Problems
